    "## Python Movie Data Collection Script\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is devised to fetch movie-related data from TheMovieDB API and, using the `imdb_id`, obtain metadata from the OMDB API, merge the datasets, and store the collected data in Parquet format. Additionally, it creates a dataset of credits from TheMovieDB API. Below is a breakdown of its functionalities:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Importing Required Libraries**:\n",
    "   - Essential libraries such as `requests`, `os`, `backoff`, and `pandas` are imported to handle HTTP requests, manage environment variables, implement retry logic, and manipulate data respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Header Configuration**:\n",
    "   - HTTP headers are configured for authorization using an API token retrieved from environment variables. Obtain the token access from [TheMovieDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) and the OMDB API key from [OMDB API](https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx). Note: The OMDB API key is limited to 1000 calls per day for free.\n",
    "   - After acquiring the keys, create a `.env` file in the root folder and populate it with the following values:\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```plaintext\n",
    "        API_KEY=\n",
    "        API_TOKEN=\n",
    "        OMDB_KEY=\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Retry Logic**:\n",
    "   - Custom retry logic is defined using the `backoff` library to handle HTTP errors, particularly focusing on status code 429 (Too Many Requests).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **API Call Function**:\n",
    "   - A function `call_get(url)` is outlined to make GET requests to the specified URL and to raise exceptions for unsuccessful responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Movie Data Retrieval Functions**:\n",
    "   - `get_latest_movie()`: Fetches the latest movie data from TheMovieDB API.\n",
    "   - `get_movie_credits_by_id(id)`: Obtains movie credits based on the movie ID from TheMovieDB API, with error handling for non-existent movie IDs.\n",
    "   - `get_movie_by_id(id)`: Retrieves movie data by ID from TheMovieDB API, also with error handling for non-existent movie IDs.\n",
    "   - `get_movie_from_omdb(imdb_id, api_key)`: Fetches movie data from the OMDB API using the IMDb ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Bulk Data Collection Functions**:\n",
    "   - `fetch_all_movies(start_id, last_id)` and `fetch_all_credits(start_id, last_id)` are crafted to loop through a range of movie IDs, collecting and merging movie data from both TheMovieDB and OMDB APIs, and movie credits from TheMovieDB API respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Data Normalization and Storage**:\n",
    "   - The script utilizes `pandas` to normalize the collected JSON data into a tabular format and subsequently stores the data in Parquet files with gzip compression, for both movies and credits data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script showcases a systematic approach to collecting, normalizing, and storing movie-related data from various online sources through API interactions. It employs robust error handling and retry logic to ensure the reliability of the data collection process.\n"
