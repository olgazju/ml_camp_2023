he said the way my blue eyes shined
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said that is a lie
just a boy in a chevy truck
that had a tendency of gettin' stuck
on backroads at night
and i was right there beside him all summer long
and then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
but when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me
september saw a month of tears
and thankin' god that you were not here
to see me like that
but in a box beneath my bed
is a letter that you never read
from three summers back
it is hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
and lookin' back on all of that it is nice to believe
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
the one we danced to all night long
the moon like a spotlight on the lake
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me
and i am back for the first time since then
i am standin' on your street
and there is a letter left on your doorstep
and the first thing that you will read is
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think my favorite song
someday you will turn your radio on
i hope it takes you back to that place
when you think happiness
i hope you think that little black dress
think of my head on your chest
and my old faded blue jeans
when you think tim mcgraw
i hope you think of me
oh think of me
mmmm
he said the way my blue eyes shine
put those georgia stars to shame that night
i said that is a lie
state the obvious i did not get my perfect fantasy
i realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
so go and tell your friends that i am obsessive and crazy
that is fine i will tell mine that you are gay
by the way
i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you are a redneck heartbreak
who is really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
as far as i am concerned you are
just another picture to burn
there is no time for tears
i am just sitting here planning my revenge
there is nothing stopping me
from going out with all of your best friends
and if you come around saying sorry to me
my daddy's gonna show you how sorry you will be
i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you are a redneck heartbreak
who is really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
as far as i am concerned you are
just another picture to burn
and if you are missing me
you would better keep it to yourself
because coming back around here
would be bad for your health
cause i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you are a redneck heartbreak
who is really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
in case you have not heard
i really really hate that
i hate that stupid old pickup truck
you never let me drive
you are a redneck heartbreak
who is really bad at lying
so watch me strike a match
on all my wasted time
as far as i am concerned you are
just another picture to burn
burn burn burn baby burn
you are just another picture to burn
baby burn
drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he will not see
that i want and i am needing
everything that we should be
i will bet she is beautiful that girl he talks about
and she is got everything that i have to live without
drew talks to me
i laugh because it is so damn funny
that i cannot even see
anyone when he is with me
he says he is so in love he is finally got it right
i wonder if he knows he is all i think about at night
he is the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he is the song in the car
i keep singing do not know why i do
drew walks by me
cannot he tell that i cannot breathe
and there he goes so perfectly
the kind of flawless i wish i could be
she would better hold him tight give him all her love
look in those beautiful eyes and know she is lucky because
he is the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
he is the song in the car
i keep singing do not know why i do
so i drive home alone as i turn off the light
i will put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
he is the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
the only one who is got enough of me to break my heart
he is the song in the car
i keep singing do not know why i do
he is the time taken up but there is never enough
and he is all that i need to fall into
drew looks at me
i fake a smile so he will not see
i do not know what i want so do not ask me
cause i am still trying to figure it out
do not know what is down this road i am just walking
trying to see through the rain coming down
even though i am not the only one
who feels the way i do
i am alone on my own and that is all i know
i will be strong i will be wrong oh but life goes on
oh i am just a girl trying to find a place in this world
got the radio on my old blue jeans
and i am wearing my heart on my sleeve
feeling lucky today got the sunshine
could you tell me what more do i need
and tomorrow's just a mystery oh yeah
but that is ok
i am alone on my own and that is all i know
i will be strong i will be wrong oh but life goes on
oh i am just a girl trying to find a place in this world
maybe i am just a girl on a mission
but i am ready to fly
i am alone on my own and that is all i know
i will be strong i will be wrong oh but life goes on
oh i am alone on my own and that is all i know
oh i am just a girl trying to find a place in this world
oh i am just a girl
oh i am just a girl oh oh
oh i am just a girl
you have a way of coming easily to me
and when you take you take the very best of me
so i start a fight cause i need to feel something
and you do what you want cause i am not what you wanted
oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
just walk away no use defending words that you will never say
and now that i am sitting here thinking it through
i have never been anywhere cold as you
you put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
and i stood there loving you and wished them all away
and you come away with a great little story
of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
just walk away no use defending words that you will never say
and now that i am sitting here thinking it through
i have never been anywhere cold as you
you never did give a damn thing honey but i cried cried for you
and i know you would not have told nobody if i died died for you
died for you
oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
every smile you fake is so condescending
counting all the scars you made
and now that i am sitting here thinking it through
i have never been anywhere cold as you
i did not know what i would find
when i went looking for a reason i know
i did not read between the lines
and baby i have got nowhere to go
i tried to take the road less traveled by
but nothing seems to work the first few times
am i right
so how can i ever try to be better
nobody ever lets me in
i can still see you this is not the best view
on the outside looking in
i have been a lot of lonely places
i have never been on the outside
you saw me there but never knew
i would give it all up to be
a part of this a part of you
and now it is all too late so you see
you could have helped if you had wanted to
but no one notices until it is too
late to do anything
so how can i ever try to be better
nobody ever lets me in
i can still see you this is not the best view
on the outside looking in
i have been a lot of lonely places
i have never been on the outside
so how can i ever try to be better
nobody ever lets me in
i can still see you this is not the best view
on the outside looking in
i have been a lot of lonely places
i have never been on the outside
seems the only one who does not see your beauty
is the face in the mirror looking back at you
you walk around here thinking you are not pretty
but that is not true because i know you
hold on
baby you are losing it
the water's high
you are jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry
but you do not tell anyone
that you might
not be the golden one
and you are tied together with a smile
but you are coming undone
i guess it is true that love was all you wanted
because you are giving it away like it is extra change
hoping it will end up in his pocket
but he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
oh because it is not his price to pay
not his price to pay
hold on
baby you are losing it
the water's high
you are jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry
but you do not tell anyone
that you might
not be the golden one
and you are tied together with a smile
but you are coming undone
hold on
baby you are losing it
the water's high
you are jumping into it
and letting go
and no one knows
that you cry
but you do not tell anyone
that you might
not be the golden one
and you are tied together with a smile
but you are coming undone
you are tied together with a smile
but you are coming undone oh
goodbye baby
with a smile baby baby
cory's eyes are like a jungle
he smiles it is like the radio
he whispers songs into my window
in words that nobody knows
these pretty girls on every corner
they watch him as he is walking home
saying does he know
will you ever know
you are beautiful
every little piece love
and do not you know
you are really gonna be someone
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life will lead you back to my door
oh but if it do not
stay beautiful
cory finds another way to be
the highlight of my day
i am taking pictures in my mind
so i can save them for a rainy day
it is hard to make a conversation
when he is taking my breath away
i should say hey by the way
you are beautiful
every little piece love
and do not you know
you are really gonna be someone
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life will lead you back to my door
oh but if it do not
stay beautiful
if you and i are a story
that never gets told
if what you are is a daydream
i will never get to hold
at least you will know
you are beautiful
every little piece love
and do not you know
you are really gonna be someone
ask anyone
and when you find everything you looked for
i hope your life will lead you back to my front door
oh but if it do not
will you stay
beautiful beautiful beautiful
beautiful beautiful beautiful
la la la
oh oh oh oh
oh but if it do not
stay beautiful
stay beautiful
na na na na na
it is strange to think the songs we used to sing
the smiles the flowers everything is gone
yesterday i found out about you
even now just looking at you feels wrong
you say that you would take it all back given one chance
it was a moment of weakness and you said yes
you should have said no you should have gone home
you should have thought twice 'fore you let it all go
you should have know that word 'bout what you did with her
get back to me get back to me
and i should have been there in the back of your mind
i should not be asking myself why
you should not be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no baby and you might still have me
you can see that i have been crying
baby you know all the right things to say
but do you honestly expect me to believe
we could ever be the same
you say that the past is the past you need one chance
it was a moment of weakness and you said yes
you should have said no you should have gone home
you should have thought twice 'fore you let it all go
you should have know that word 'bout what you did with her
get back to me get back to me
and i should have been there in the back of your mind
i should not be asking myself why
you should not be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no baby and you might still have me
i cannot resist
before you go tell me this
was it worth it
was she worth this
no no no no
you should have said no you should have gone home
you should have thought twice 'fore you let it all go
you should have know that word 'bout what you did with her
get back to me get back to me
and i should have been there in the back of your mind
i should not be asking myself why
you should not be begging for forgiveness at my feet
you should have said no baby and you might still have me
she said i was seven and you were nine
i looked at you like the stars that shined
in the sky the pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
and rolled their eyes and said oh my my my
take me back to the house in the backyard tree
said you would beat me up you were bigger than me
you never did you never did
take me back when our world was one block wide
i dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
just two kids you and i
oh my my my my
well i was sixteen when suddenly
i was not that little girl you used to see
but your eyes still shined like pretty lights
and our daddies used to joke about the two of us
they never believed we would really fall in love
and our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
and said oh my my my
take me back to the creek beds we turned up
two am riding in your truck and all i need is you next to me
take me back to the time we had our very first fight
the slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
you stayed outside till the morning light
oh my my my my
a few years had gone and come around
we were sitting at our favorite spot in town
and you looked at me got down on one knee
take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
our whole town came and our mamas cried
you said i do and i did too
take me home where we met so many years before
we will rock our babies on that very front porch
after all this time you and i
i will be eightyseven you will be eightynine
i will still look at you like the stars that shine
in the sky oh my my my
i was riding shotgun with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
he is got a onehand feel on the steering wheel
the other on my heart
i look around turn the radio down
he says baby is something wrong
i say nothing i was just thinking
how we do not have a song
and he says
our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin' out late tapping on your window
when we are on the phone and you talk real slow
because it is late and your mama do not know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date man i did not kiss her and i should have
and when i got home 'fore i said amen
asking god if he could play it again
i was walking up the front porch steps
after everything that day
had gone all wrong and been trampled on
and lost and thrown away
got to the hallway well on my way
to my lovin' bed
i almost did not notice all the roses
and the note that said
our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin' out late tapping on your window
when we are on the phone and you talk real slow
because it is late and your mama do not know
our song is the way you laugh
the first date man i did not kiss her and i should have
and when i got home 'fore i said amen
asking god if he could play it again
i have heard every album listened to the radio
waited for something to come along
that was as good as our song
because our song is the slamming screen door
sneakin' out late tapping on his window
when we are on the phone and he talks real slow
because it is late and his mama do not know
our song is the way he laughs
the first date man i did not kiss him and i should have
and when i got home 'fore i said amen
asking god if he could play it again
play it again
i was riding shotgun with my hair undone
in the front seat of his car
i grabbed a pen and an old napkin
and i wrote down our song
friday night beneath the stars
in a field behind your yard
you and i are painting pictures in the sky
and sometimes we do not say a thing
just listen to the crickets sing
everything i need is right here by my side
and i know everything about you
i do not wanna live without you
i am only up when you are not down
do not wanna fly if you are still on the ground
it is like no matter what i do
well you drive me crazy half the time
the other half i am only trying to let you know that what i feel is true
and i am only me when i am with you
just a small town boy and girl
living in a crazy world
trying to figure out what is and is not true
and i do not try to hide my tears
the secrets or my deepest fears
through it all nobody gets me like you do
and you know everything about me
you say that you cannot live without me
i am only up when you are not down
do not wanna fly if you are still on the ground
it is like no matter what i do
well you drive me crazy half the time
the other half i am only trying to let you know that what i feel is true
and i am only me when i am with you
when i am with anybody else it is so hard to be myself
only you can tell
that i am only up when you are not down
do not wanna fly if you are still on the ground
it is like no matter what i do
well you drive me crazy half the time
the other half i am only trying to let you know that what i feel is true
and i am only me
who i wanna be
well i am only me when i am with you
with you
uh huh
yeah
she cannot see the way your eyes
light up when you smile
she will never notice how you stop and stare
whenever she walks by
and you cannot see me wanting you the way you want her
but you are everything to me
i just want to show you
she do not even know you
she is never going to love you like i want to
and you just see right through me
if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful
miracle
unbelievable
instead of just invisible
there is a fire inside of you
that cannot help but shine through
she is never going to see the light
no matter what you do
and all i think about is how to make you think of me
and everything that we could be
i just want to show you
she do not even know you
she is never going to love you like i want to
and you just see right through me
if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful
miracle
unbelievable
instead of just invisible
like shadows in a faded light
oh we are invisible
i just want to open your eyes
and make you realize
i just want to show you
she do not even know you
baby let me love you
let me want you
you just see right through me
but if you only knew me
we could be a beautiful
miracle
unbelievable
instead of just invisible
she cannot see the way your eyes
light up when you smile
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
why would you wanna make the very first scar
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
maybe i should have seen the signs should have read the writing on the wall
and realized by the distance in your eyes that i would be the one to fall
no matter what you say i still cannot believe
that you would walk away
it do not make sense to me but
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apartnow
why would you wanna make the very first scar
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
it is not unbroken anymore
how do i get it back the way it was before
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
why would you wanna make the very first scar
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
why would you wanna make the very first scar
why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
there is something 'bout the way
the street looks when it is just rained
there is a glow off the pavement
you walk me to the car
and you know i wanna ask you to dance right there
in the middle of the parking lot yeah
oh yeah
we are driving down the road
i wonder if you know
i am trying so hard not to get caught up now
but you are just so cool
run your hands through your hair
absent mindedly making me want you
and i do not know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and i do not know why but with you i would dance in a storm in my best dress
fearless
so baby drive slow
'til we run out of road in this one horse town
i wanna stay right here in this passenger's seat
you put your eyes on me
in this moment now capture it remember it
and i do not know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and i do not know why but with you i would dance in a storm in my best dress
fearless
well you stood there with me in the doorway
my hands shake i am not usually this way but
you pull me in and i am a little more brave
it is the first kiss it is flawless really something
it is fearless
oh yeah
and i do not know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and i do not know why but with you i would dance in a storm in my best dress
fearless
and i do not know how it gets better than this
you take my hand and drag me head first
fearless
and i do not know why but with you i would dance in a storm in my best dress
fearless
oh oh
oh yeah
you take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
it is the morning of your very first day
you say hi to your friends you is not seen in a while
try and stay out of everybody's way
it is your freshman year and you are going to be here
for the next four years in this town
hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
you know i have not seen you around before
because when you are fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you are going to believe them
and when you are fifteen feeling like there is nothing to figure out
well count to ten take it in
this is life before you know who you are going to be
fifteen
you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail
and soon enough you are best friends
laughing at the other girls who think they are so cool
we will be outta here as soon as we can
and then you are on your very first date and he is got a car
and you are feeling like flying
and your momma's waiting up and you are thinking he is the one
and you are dancing 'round your room when the night ends
when the night ends
because when you are fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you are going to believe them
when you are fifteen and your first kiss
makes your head spin 'round
but in your life you will do things greater than
dating the boy on the football team
but i did not know it at fifteen
when all you wanted was to be wanted
wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
back then i swore i was going to marry him someday
but i realized some bigger dreams of mine
and abigail gave everything she had to a boy
who changed his mind and we both cried
because when you are fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
you are going to believe them
and when you are fifteen do not forget to look before you fall
i have found time can heal most anything
and you just might find who you are supposed to be
i did not know who i was supposed to be at fifteen
la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la
your very first day
take a deep breath girl
take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
we were both young when i first saw you
i close my eyes and the flashback starts
i am standing there
on a balcony in summer air
see the lights see the party the ball gowns
see you make your way through the crowd
and say hello
little did i know
that you were romeo you were throwing pebbles
and my daddy said stay away from juliet
and i was crying on the staircase
begging you please do not go and i said
romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
i will be waiting all there is left to do is run
you will be the prince and i will be the princess
it is a love story baby just say yes
so i sneak out to the garden to see you
we keep quiet because we are dead if they knew
so close your eyes
escape this town for a little while
because you were romeo i was a scarlet letter
and my daddy said stay away from juliet
but you were everything to me
i was begging you please do not go and i said
romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
i will be waiting all there is left to do is run
you will be the prince and i will be the princess
it is a love story baby just say yes
romeo save me they are trying to tell me how to feel
this love is difficult but it is real
do not be afraid we will make it out of this mess
it is a love story baby just say yes
oh oh
i got tired of waiting
wondering if you were ever coming around
my faith in you was fading
when i met you on the outskirts of town and i said
romeo save me i have been feeling so alone
i keep waiting for you but you never come
is this in my head i do not know what to think
he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
and said marry me juliet
you will never have to be alone
i love you and that is all i really know
i talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
it is a love story baby just say 'yes'
oh oh
oh oh
because we were both young when i first saw you
hey stephen i know looks can be deceiving
but i know i saw a light in you
and as we walked we were talking
i did not say half the things i wanted to
of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
i will be the one waiting there even when it is cold
hey stephen boy you might have me believing
i do not always have to be alone
because i cannot help it if you look like an angel
cannot help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain so
come feel this magic i have been feeling since i met you
cannot help it if there is no one else
mmm i cannot help myself
hey stephen i have been holding back this feeling
so i got some things to say to you

but i never seen nobody shine the way you do
the way you walk way you talk way you say my name

i am waiting alone now so come on and come out
and pull me near and shine shine shine
hey stephen i could give you fifty reasons
why i should be the one you choose
all those other girls well they are beautiful
but would they write a song for you
because i cannot help it if you look like an angel
cannot help it if i wanna kiss you in the rain so
come feel this magic i have been feeling since i met you
cannot help it if there is no one else
mmm i cannot help myself
because i cannot help it if you look like an angel

come feel this magic i have been feeling since i met you
cannot help it if there is no one else
mmm i cannot help myself
myself
cannot help myself
i cannot help myself
say you are sorry that face of an angel
comes out just when you need it to
as i paced back and forth all this time
because i honestly believed in you
holdin' on the days drag on
stupid girl i shoulda known i shoulda known
that i am not a princess this is not a fairytale
i am not the one you will sweep off her feet lead her up the stairwell
this is not hollywood this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
now it is too late for you and your white horse
to come around
baby i was naive got lost in your eyes
and never really had a chance
my mistake i did not know to be in love
you had to fight to have the upper hand
i had so many dreams about you and me
happy endings now i know
that i am not a princess this is not a fairytale
i am not the one you will sweep off her feet lead her up the stairwell
this is not hollywood this is a small town
i was a dreamer before you went and let me down
now it is too late for you and your white horse
to come around
and there you are on your knees
beggin' for forgiveness beggin' for me
just like i always wanted
but i am so sorry
because i am not your princess this is not our fairytale
i am gonna find someone someday
who might actually treat me well
this is a big world that was a small town
there in my rear view mirror disappearing now
and it is too late for you and your white horse
now it is too late for you and your white horse
to catch me now
oh whoa whoa whoa
try and catch me now oh
it is too late to catch me now
you are on the phone with your girlfriend she is upset
she is going off about something that you said
because she does not get your humor like i do
i am in the room it is a typical tuesday night
i am listening to the kind of music she does not like
and she will never know your story like i do
but she wears short skirts i wear tshirts
she is cheer captain and i am on the bleachers
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
that what you are looking for has been here the whole time
if you could see that i am the one who understands you
been here all along so why cannot you see
you belong with me you belong with me
walking the streets with you and your wornout jeans
i cannot help thinking this is how it ought to be
laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
hey is not this easy
and you have got a smile that could light up this whole town
i have not seen it in a while since she brought you down
you say you are fine i know you better than that
hey whatcha doing with a girl like that
she wears high heels i wear sneakers
she is cheer captain and i am on the bleachers
dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
that what you are looking for has been here the whole time
if you could see that i am the one who understands you
been here all along so why cannot you see
you belong with me
standing by and waiting at your back door
all this time how could you not know baby
you belong with me you belong with me
oh i remember you driving to my house
in the middle of the night
i am the one who makes you laugh
when you know you are 'bout to cry
and i know your favorite songs
and you tell me 'bout your dreams
think i know where you belong
think i know it is with me
cannot you see that i am the one who understands you
been here all along so why cannot you see
you belong with me
standing by and waiting at your back door
all this time how could you not know baby
you belong with me you belong with me
you belong with me
have you ever thought just maybe
you belong with me
you belong with me
i see your face in my mind as i drive away
because none of us thought it was
going to end that way
people are people
and sometimes we change our minds
but it is killing me to see you go after all this time
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm
music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
it is the kind of ending you
do not really want to see
because it is tragedy and it will only bring you
down
now i do not know what to be without you around
and we know it is never simple never easy
never a clean break no one here to
save me
you are the only thing i know like the back of my hand
and i cannot
breathe
without you but i have to breathe
without you but i have to
never wanted this never want to see you hurt
every little bump in the road i tried to swerve
but people are people
and sometimes it does not work out
nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
it is 2 am
feeling like i just lost a friend
hope you know it is not easy
easy for me
it is 2 am
feeling like i just lost a friend
hope you know this is not easy
easy for me
sorry sorry
sorry yeah eh sorry
sorry sorry
sorry
i took a chance
i took a shot
and you might think i am bulletproof
but i am not
you took a swing
i took it hard
and down here from the ground i see who you are
i am sick and tired of your attitude
i am feeling like i do not know you
you tell me that you love me then you cut me down
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
that makes me run for cover when you are around
and here is to you and your temper
yes i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you are doing to me
tell me why
you could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
well i get so confused and frustrated
forget what i am trying to say oh
i am sick and tired of your reasons
i got no one to believe in
you tell me that you want me then push me around
and i need you like a heartbeat
but you know you got a mean streak
that makes me run for cover when you are around
here is to you and your temper
yes i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you are doing to me
tell me why
why do you have to make me feel small
so you can feel whole inside
why do you have to put down my dreams
so you are the only thing on my mind
i am sick and tired of your attitude
i am feeling like i do not know you
you tell me that you want me then cut me down
i am sick and tired of your reasons
i have got no one to believe in
you ask me for my love then you push me around
here is to you and your temper
yes i remember what you said last night
and i know that you see what you are doing to me
tell me why why
tell me why why
i take a step back let you go
i told you i am not bulletproof
now you know
all this time i was wasting hoping you would come around
i have been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
and it is taken me this long baby but i have figured you out
and you are thinking we will be fine again but not this time around
you do not have to call anymore
i will not pick up the phone
this is the last straw
do not wanna hurt anymore
and you can tell me that you are sorry
but i do not believe you baby like i did before
you are not sorry no no no no
you are looking so innocent
i might believe you if i did not know
could have loved you all my life if you had not left me waiting in the cold
and you have got your share of secrets
and i am tired of being last to know
and now you are asking me to listen because it is worked each time before but
you do not have to call anymore
i will not pick up the phone
this is the last straw
do not wanna hurt anymore
and you can tell me that you are sorry
but i do not believe you baby like i did before
you are not sorry no no no no
you are not sorry no no no no
you had me crawling for you honey and it never would have gone away
you used to shine so bright but i watched all of it fade so
you do not have to call anymore
i will not pick up the phone
this is the last straw
there is nothing left to beg for
and you can tell me that you are sorry
but i do not believe you baby like i did before
you are not sorry no no no no
you are not sorry no no no no
no no no
he is sensible and so incredible
and all my single friends are jealous
he says everything i need to hear and it is like
i could not ask for anything better
he opens up my door and i get into his car
and he says you look beautiful tonight
and i feel perfectly fine
but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
and it is 2am and i am cursing your name
you are so in love that you act insane
and that is the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
it is a roller coaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that is the way i loved you
he respects my space
and never makes me wait
and he calls exactly when he says he will
he is close to my mother
talks business with my father
he is charming and endearing
and i am comfortable
he cannot see the smile i am faking
and my heart's not breaking
because i am not feeling anything at all
and you were wild and crazy
just so frustrating intoxicating
complicated got away by some mistake and now
i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
it is 2am and i am cursing your name
i am so in love that i acted insane
and that is the way i loved you
breaking down and coming undone
it is a roller coaster kind of rush
and i never knew i could feel that much
and that is the way i loved you oh oh
and that is the way i loved you oh oh
never knew i could feel that much
and that is the way i loved you
once upon a time
i believe it was a tuesday when i caught your eye
and we caught onto something
i hold onto the night you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
were you just kidding
because it seems to me this thing is breaking down
we almost never speak
i do not feel welcome anymore
baby what happened please tell me
because one second it was perfect now you are halfway out the door
and i stare at the phone he still has not called
and then you feel so low you cannot feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said forever and always
oh and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you are here and it rains when you are gone
because i was there when you said forever and always
was i out of line
did i say something way too honest made you run and hide
like a scared little boy
i looked into your eyes
thought i knew you for a minute now i am not so sure
so here is to everything coming down to nothing
here is to silence that cuts me to the core
where is this going
thought i knew for a minute but i do not anymore
and i stare at the phone he still has not called
and then you feel so low you cannot feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when he said forever and always
oh and it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you are here and it rains when you are gone
because i was there when you said forever and always
you did not mean it baby i do not think so
oh back up baby back up
did you forget everything
back up baby back up
did you forget everything
because it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you are here and it rains when you are gone
because i was there when you said forever and always
oh i stare at the phone he still has not called
and then you feel so low you cannot feel nothing at all
and you flashback to when we said forever and always
and  it rains in your bedroom
everything is wrong
it rains when you are here and it rains when you are gone
because i was there when you said forever and always
you did not mean it baby you said forever and always yeah
i am five years old it is getting cold i have got my big coat on
i hear your laugh and look up smiling at you i run and run
past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
look now the sky is gold
i hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
i do not know why all the trees change in the fall
but i know you are not scared of anything at all
do not know if snow white's house is near or far away
but i know i had the best day with you today
i am thirteen now
and do not know how my friends could be so mean
i come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
and we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
and we talk and window shop 'til i have forgotten all their names
i do not know who i am going to talk to now at school
but i know i am laughing on the car ride home with you
do not know how long it is going to take to feel okay
but i know i had the best day with you today
i have an excellent father his strength is making me stronger
god smiles on my little brother inside and out
he is better than i am
i grew up in a pretty house and i had space to run
and i had the best days with you
there is a video i found from back when i was three
you set up a paint set in the kitchen and you are talking to me
it is the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
and daddy's smart
and you are the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
and now i know why all the trees change in the fall
i know you were on my side even when i was wrong
and i love you for giving me your eyes
for staying back and watching me shine
and i did not know if you knew so i am taking this chance to say
that i had the best day with you today
and it is a sad picture the final blow hits you
somebody else gets what you wanted again and
you know it is all the same another time and place
repeating history and you are getting sick of it
but i believe in whatever you do
and i will do anything to see it through
because these things will change
can you feel it now
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution the time will come
for us to finally win
and we will sing hallelujah we will sing hallelujah
oh oh
so we have been outnumbered raided and now cornered
it is hard to fight when the fight is not fair
we are getting stronger now finding things they never found
they might be bigger but we are faster and never scared
you can walk away say we do not need this
but there is something in your eyes says we can beat this
because these things will change
can you feel it now
these walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
this revolution the time will come
for us to finally win
and we will sing hallelujah we will sing hallelujah
oh oh
tonight we stand get off our knees
fight for what we have worked for all these years
and the battle was long it is the fight of our lives
but we will stand up champions tonight
it was the night things changed
can you see it now
these walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
it is a revolution throw your hands up
because we never gave in
and we will sing hallelujah we sang hallelujah
hallelujah
you were in college working parttime waiting tables
left a small town and never looked back
i was a flight risk with a fear of falling
wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts
i say can you believe it
as we are lying on the couch
the moment i could see it
yes yes i can see it now
do you remember we were sitting there by the water
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that is ever been mine
flash forward and we are taking on the world together
and there is a drawer of my things at your place
you learn my secrets and figure out why i am guarded
you say we will never make my parents' mistakes
but we got bills to pay
we got nothing figured out
when it was hard to take
yes yes
this is what i thought about
do you remember we were sitting there by the water
you put your arm around me for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that is ever been mine
do you remember all the city lights on the water
you saw me start to believe for the first time
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that is ever been mine
and i remember that fight 230 am
as everything was slipping right out of our hands
i ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
braced myself for the goodbye
because that is all i have ever known
then you took me by surprise
you said i will never leave you alone
you said i remember how we felt sitting by the water
and every time i look at you it is like the first time
i fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
she is the best thing that is ever been mine
hold on make it last
hold on never turn back
you made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
you are the best thing that is ever been mine
yeah yeah
do you believe it
hold on
we are gonna make it now
hold on
and i can see it
yeah yeah
i can see it now see it now
the way you move is like a full on rainstorm
and i am a house of cards
you are the kind of reckless
that should send me running
but i kinda know that i will not get far
and you stood there in front of me
just close enough to touch
close enough to hope you could not see
what i was thinking of
drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
because i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you are not around
because i see sparks fly whenever you smile
my mind forgets to remind me
you are a bad idea
you touch me once and it is really something
you find i am even better than you imagined i would be
i am on my guard for the rest of the world
but with you i know it is no good
and i could wait patiently but i really wish you would
drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
because i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you are not around
because i see sparks fly whenever you smile
i run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
just keep on keeping your eyes on me it is just wrong enough to make it feel right
and lead me up the staircase
will not you whisper soft and slow
i am captivated by you baby like a firework show
drop everything now
meet me in the pouring rain
kiss me on the sidewalk
take away the pain
because i see sparks fly whenever you smile
get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
give me something that'll haunt me when you are not around
because i see sparks fly whenever you smile
and the sparks fly
oh baby smile
and the sparks fly
i am so glad you made time to see me
how is life tell me how is your family
i have not seen them in a while
you have been good busier than ever
we small talk work and the weather
your guard is up and i know why
because the last time you saw me
is still burned in the back of your mind
you gave me roses and i left them there to die
so this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying i am sorry for that night
and i would go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom is not nothing but missing you
wishing i would realized what i had when you were mine
i would go back to december turn around and make it alright
i go back to december all the time
these days i have not been sleeping
staying up playing back myself leaving
when your birthday passed and i did not call
and i think about summer all the beautiful times
i watched you laughing from the passenger side and
realized i loved you in the fall
and then the cold came
the dark days when fear crept into my mind
you gave me all your love and all i gave you was goodbye
so this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying i am sorry for that night
and i would go back to december all the time
it turns out freedom is not nothing but missing you
wishing i would realized what i had when you were mine
i would go back to december turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time
i miss your tan skin your sweet smile so good to me so right
and how you held me in your arms that september night
the first time you ever saw me cry
maybe this is wishful thinking
probably mindless dreaming
but if we loved again i swear i would love you right
i would go back in time and change it but i cannot
so if the chain is on your door i understand
but this is me swallowing my pride
standing in front of you saying i am sorry for that night
and i would go back to december
it turns out freedom is not nothing but missing you
wishing i would realized what i had when you were mine
i would go back to december turn around and make it alright
i would go back to december turn around and change my own mind
i go back to december all the time
all the time
i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely barging in
on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl
i sneak in and see your friends
and her snotty little family
all dressed in pastel
and she is yelling at a bridesmaid
somewhere back inside a room
wearing a gown shaped like a pastry
this is surely not
what you thought it would be
i lose myself in a daydream
where i stand and say
do not say yes run away now
i will meet you when you are out
of the church at the back door
do not wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said speak now
fond gestures are exchanged
and the organ starts to play
a song that sounds like a death march
and i am hiding in the curtains
it seems that i was uninvited
by your lovely bridetobe
she floats down the aisle
like a pageant queen
but i know you wish it was me
you wish it was me do not you
do not say yes run away now
i will meet you when you are out
of the church at the back door
do not wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said speak now
do not say yes run away now
i will meet you when you are out
of the church at the back door
do not wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said speak now
ooh ladadada oh
ooh ooh
say a single vow
i hear the preacher say
speak now or forever hold your peace
there is the silence there is my last chance
i stand up with shaking hands all eyes on me
horrified looks from everyone in the room
but i am only looking at you
i am not the kind of girl
who should be rudely barging in
on a white veil occasion
but you are not the kind of boy
who should be marrying the wrong girl
hehe
do not say yes run away now
i will meet you when you are out
of the church at the back door
do not wait or say a single vow
you need to hear me out
and they said speak now
and you say
let us run away now
i will meet you when
i am out of my tux at the back door
baby i did not say my vows
so glad you were around when they said
speak now
long were the nights when
my days once revolved around you
counting my footsteps
praying the floor will not fall through again
my mother accused me of losing my mind
but i swore i was fine
you paint me a blue sky
then go back and turn it to rain
and i lived in your chess game
but you changed the rules everyday
wonderin' which version of you i might get on the phone tonight
well i stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why
dear john i see it all now that you are gone
do not you think i was too young to be messed with
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i shoulda' known
well maybe it is me
and my blind optimism to blame
or maybe it is you and your sick need
to give love and take it away
and you will add my name to your long list of traitors
who do not understand
and i look back in regret how i ignored when they said
run as fast as you can
dear john i see it all now that you are gone
do not you think i was too young to be messed with
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
dear john i see it all now it was wrong
do not you think nineteen's too young
to be played by your dark twisted games
when i loved you so
i shoulda' known
you are an expert at sorry
and keeping the lines blurry
never impressed by me acing your tests
all the girls that you have run dry have tired lifeless eyes
because you burned them out
but i took your matches
before fire could catch me
so do not look now
i am shining like fireworks
over your sad empty town yeah
oh oh oh oh oh oh
dear john i see it all now that you are gone
do not you think i was too young to be messed with
the girl in the dress cried the whole way home
i see it all now that you are gone
do not you think i was too young to be messed with
the girl in the dress
wrote you a song you shoulda' known
you shoulda' known
do not you think i was too young
you shoulda' known
you with your words like knives
and swords and weapons that you use against me
you have knocked me off my feet again
got me feeling like i am nothing
you with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
calling me out when i am wounded
you picking on the weaker man
but you can take me down with just one single blow
but you do not know what you do not know
someday i will be living in a big old city
and all you are ever gonna be is mean
someday i will be big enough so you cannot hit me
and all you are ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean
you with your switching sides
and your wildfire lies and your humiliation
you have pointed out my flaws again
as if i do not already see them
i walk with my head down trying to block you out
because i will never impress you
i just want to feel okay again
i bet you got pushed around
somebody made you cold
but the cycle ends right now
because you cannot lead me down that road
and you do not know what you do not know
someday i will be living in a big old city
and all you are ever gonna be is mean
someday i will be big enough so you cannot hit me
and all you are ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean
and i can see you years from now in a bar
talking over a football game
with that same big loud opinion
but nobody's listening
washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
drunk and grumbling on about how i cannot sing
but all you are is mean
all you are is mean
and a liar and pathetic and alone in life
and mean and mean and mean and mean
but someday i will be living in a big old city
and all you are ever going to be is mean yeah
someday i will be big enough so you cannot hit me
and all you are ever going to be is mean
why you gotta be so mean
someday i will be living in a big old city
why you gotta be so mean
and all you are ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean
someday i will be big enough so you cannot hit me
why you gotta be so mean
and all you are ever gonna be is mean
why you gotta be so mean
i used to think one day we would tell the story of us
how we met
and the sparks flew instantly
and people would say they are the lucky ones
i used to know my place was a spot next to you
now i am searching the room for an empty seat
because lately i do not even know what page you are on
oh a simple complication
miscommunications lead to fallout
so many things that i wish you knew
so many walls up that i cannot break through
now i am standing alone in a crowded room
and we are not speaking
and i am dying to know
is it killing you like it is killing me
yeah i do not know what to say since a twist of fate when it all broke down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
next chapter
how did we end up this way
see me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
and you are doing your best to avoid me
i am starting to think one day i will tell the story of us
of how i was losing my mind when i saw you here
but you held your pride like you should have held me
oh i am scared to see the ending
why are we pretending this is nothing
i would tell you i miss you but i do not know how
i have never heard silence quite this loud
now i am standing alone in a crowded room
and we are not speaking
and i am dying to know
is it killing you like it is killing me
yeah and i do not know what to say since a twist of fate when it all broke down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
this is looking like a contest
of who can act like they care less
but i liked it better when you were on my side
the battle's in your hands now
but i would lay my armor down
if you say you would rather love than fight
so many things that you wish i knew
but the story of us might be ending soon
now i am standing alone in a crowded room
and we are not speaking
and i am dying to know
is it killing you like it is killing me
yeah and i do not know what to say since a twist of fate when it all broke down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now now now
and we are not speaking
and i am dying to know is it killing you like it is killing me
yeah
and i do not know what to say since a twist of fate because we are going down
and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
the end
your little hand's wrapped around my finger
and it is so quiet in the world tonight
your little eyelids flutter cause you are dreaming
so i tuck you in turn on your favorite night light
to you everything's funny you got nothing to regret
i would give all i have honey
if you could stay like that
oh darling do not you ever grow up
do not you ever grow up just stay this little
oh darling do not you ever grow up
do not you ever grow up it could stay this simple
i will not let nobody hurt you will not let no one break your heart
and no one will desert you
just try to never grow up never grow up
you are in the car on the way to the movies
and you are mortified your mom's dropping you off
at 14 there is just so much you cannot do
and you cannot wait to move out someday and call your own shots
but do not make her drop you off around the block
remember that she is getting older too
and do not lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school
oh darling do not you ever grow up
do not you ever grow up just stay this little
oh darling do not you ever grow up
do not you ever grow up it could stay this simple
no one's ever burned you nothing's ever left you scarred
and even though you want to just try to never grow up
take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
remember the footsteps remember the words said
and all your little brother's favorite songs
i just realized everything i have is someday gonna be gone
so here i am in my new apartment
in a big city they just dropped me off
it is so much colder that i thought it would be
so i tuck myself in and turn my night light on
wish i would never grown up
i wish i would never grown up
oh i do not wanna grow up wish i would never grown up
i could still be little
oh i do not wanna grow up wish i would never grown up
it could still be simple
oh darling do not you ever grow up
do not you ever grow up just stay this little
oh darling do not you ever grow up
do not you ever grow up it could stay this simple
will not let nobody hurt you
will not let no one break your heart
and even though you want to please try to never grow up
oh do not you ever grow up
oh never grow up just never grow up
there i was again tonight
forcing laughter faking smiles
same old tired lonely place
walls of insincerity shifting eyes and vacancy
vanished when i saw your face
all i can say is
it was enchanting to meet you
your eyes whispered have we met
across the room your silhouette
starts to make its way to me
the playful conversation starts
counter all your quick remarks
like passing notes in secrecy
and it was
enchanting to meet you
all i can say is
i was enchanted to meet you
this night is sparkling
do not you let it go
i am wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
i will spend forever
wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you
the lingering question kept me up
2am who do you love
i wonder 'til i am wide awake
and now i am pacing back and forth
wishing you were at my door
i would open up and you would say hey
it was
enchanting to meet you
all i know is i was
enchanted to meet you
this night is sparkling
do not you let it go
i am wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
i will spend forever
wondering if you knew
this night is flawless
do not you let it go
i am wonderstruck
dancing around all alone
i will spend forever
wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you
this is me praying that
this was the very first page
not where the storyline ends
my thoughts will echo your name
until i see you again
these are the words i held back
as i was leaving too soon
i was enchanted to meet you
please do not be in love
with someone else
please do not have somebody
waiting on you
please do not be in love
with someone else
please do not have somebody
waiting on you
this night is sparkling
do not you let it go
i am wonderstruck
blushing all the way home
i will spend forever
wondering if you knew
this night is flawless
do not you let it go
i am wonderstruck
dancing around all alone
i will spend forever
wondering if you knew
i was enchanted to meet you
please do not be in love
with someone else
please do not have somebody
waiting on you
now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
ha time for a little revenge
the story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
i had it all i had him right there where i wanted him
she came along got him alone and let us hear the applause
she took him faster than you can say sabotage
i never saw it coming would not have suspected it
i underestimated just who i was dealing with
she had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum

she looks at life like it is a party and she is on the list
she looks at me like i am a trend and she is so over it
i think her everpresent frown is a little troubling
and she thinks i am psycho because i like to rhyme her name with things
but sophistication is not what you wear or who you know
or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
oh they did not teach you that in prep school so it is up to me
but no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
she is not a saint and she is not what you think
she is an actress whoa
she is better known for the things that she does
on the mattress whoa
soon she is gonna find stealing other people's toys
on the playground will not make you many friends
she should keep in mind she should keep in mind
there is nothing i do better than revenge ha

she took him faster than you could say sabotage
i guess you really did it this time
left yourself in your warpath
lost your balance on a tightrope
lost your mind trying to get it back
was not it easier in your lunchbox days
always a bigger bed to crawl into
was not it beautiful when you believed in everything
and everybody believed in you
it is alright just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me
oh who you are is not where you have been
you are still an innocent
you are still an innocent
did some things you cannot speak of
but at night you live it all again
you would not be shattered on the floor now
if only you had seen what you know now then
was not it easier in your fireflycatching days
when everything out of reach someone bigger brought down to you
was not it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
before the monsters caught up to you
it is alright just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me
ohwho you are is not where you have been
you are still an innocent
it is okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growing up now
who you are is not what you did
you are still an innocent
time turns flames to embers
you will have new septembers
every one of us has messed up too
lives change like the weather
i hope you remember
today is never too late to be brand new
it is alright just wait and see
your string of lights is still bright to me
oh who you are is not where you have been
you are still an innocent
it is okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growing up now
who you are is not what you did
you are still an innocent
you are still an innocent
lost your balance on a tightrope
it is never too late to get it back
you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
but i never thought i would live to see it break
it is getting dark and it is all too quiet
and i cannot trust anything now
and it is coming over you like it is all a big mistake
whoa holding my breath
will not lose you again
something's made your eyes go cold
c'mon c'mon do not leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you are all i wanted
c'mon c'mon do not leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
cannot breathe whenever you are gone
cannot turn back now i am haunted
stood there and watched you walk away
from everything we had
but i still mean every word i said to you
he will try to take away my pain
and he just might make me smile
but the whole time i am wishing it was you instead
oh holding my breath
will not see you again
something keeps me holding onto nothing
c'mon c'mon do not leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
something's gone terribly wrong
you are all i wanted
c'mon c'mon do not leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
cannot breathe whenever you are gone

c'mon c'mon do not leave me like this
i thought i had you figured out
cannot breathe whenever you are gone
cannot turn back now i am haunted
oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
you and i walk a fragile line
i have known it all this time
never ever thought i would see it break
never thought i would see it
i still remember the look on your face
lit through the darkness at 158
the words that you whispered
for just us to know
you told me you loved me
so why did you go away
away
i do recall now the smell of the rain
fresh on the pavement
i ran off the plane
that july 9th
the beat of your heart
it jumps through your shirt
i can still feel your arms
but now i will go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is
i do not know how to be something you miss
i never thought we would have a last kiss
never imagined we would end like this
your name forever the name on my lips
i do remember the swing of your step
the life of the party you are showing off again
and i roll my eyes and then
you pull me in
i am not much for dancing
but for you i did
because i love your handshake meeting my father
i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
how you kissed me when i was in the middle of saying something
there is not a day i do not miss those rude interruptions
but now i will go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is
i do not know how to be something you miss
i never thought we would have a last kiss
never imagined we would end like this
your name forever the name on my lips
so i will watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep
and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe
and i keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
hope it is nice where you are
and i hope the sun shines
and it is a beautiful day
and something reminds you
you wish you had stayed
you can plan for a change in weather and time
but i never planned on you changing your mind
so i will go sit on the floor
wearing your clothes
all that i know is
i do not know how to be something you miss
i never thought we would have a last kiss
never imagined we would end like this
your name forever the name on my lips
just like our last kiss
forever the name on my lips
forever the name on my lips
just like our last
i said remember this moment in the back of my mind
the time we stood with our shaking hands
the crowds in the stands went wild
we were the kings and the queens
and they read off our names
the night you danced like you knew our lives
would never be the same
you held your head like a hero
on a history book page
it was the end of a decade
but the start of an age
long live the walls we crashed through
all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
i was screaming long live all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
one day we will be remembered
i said remember this feeling
i passed the pictures around
of all the years that we stood there
on the sidelines wishing for right now
we are the kings and the queens
you traded your baseball cap for a crown
when they gave us our trophies
and we held them up for our town
and the cynics were outraged
screaming this is absurd
cause for a moment a band of thieves
in ripped up jeans got to rule the world
long live the walls we crashed through
all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
i was screaming long live all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
i am not afraid
long live all the mountains we moved
i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
i was screaming long live that look on your face
and bring on all the pretenders
one day we will be remembered
hold on to spinning around
confetti falls to the ground
may these memories break our fall
will you take a moment
promise me this
that you will stand by me forever
but if god forbid fate should step in
and force us into a goodbye
if you have children some day
when they point to the pictures
please tell them my name
tell them how the crowds went wild
tell them how i hope they shine
long live the walls we crashed through
i had the time of my life with you
long long live the walls we crashed through
all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
i was screaming long live all the magic we made
and bring on all the pretenders
i am not afraid
singing long live all the mountains we moved
i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
and long long live that look on your face
and bring on all the pretenders
one day we will be remembered
elevator buttons and morning air
strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
if you were here we would laugh about their vacant stares
but right now my time is theirs
seems like there is always someone who disapproves
they will judge it like they know about me and you
and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
the jury's out but my choice is you
so do not you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high the water's rough
but this love is ours
you never know what people have up their sleeves
ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
but i do not care because right now you are mine
and you will say
do not you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
the stakes are high the water's rough
but this love is ours
and it is not theirs to speculate if it is wrong
and your hands are tough but they are where mine belong
and i will fight their doubt and give you faith
with this song for you
because i love the gap between your teeth
and i love the riddles that you speak
and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
because my heart is yours
so do not you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
do not you worry your pretty little mind
people throw rocks at things that shine
but they cannot take what is ours
they cannot take what is ours
the stakes are high the water's rough
but this love is ours
last night i heard my own heart beating
sounded like footsteps on my stairs
six months gone and i am still reaching
even though i know you are not there
i was playing back a thousand memories baby
thinkin' 'bout everything we have been through
maybe i have been going back too much lately
when time stood still and i had you
come back come back come back to me like
you would you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside till i came out
come back come back come back to me like
you could you could if you just said you are sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie you would be here by now
i know people change and these things happen
but i remember how it was back then
wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
cause nothing like this ever happened to them
now i am pacing down the hall chasing down your street
flashback to the night when you said to me
nothing's gonna change not for me and you
not before i knew how much i had to lose
come back come back come back to me like
you would you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside till i came out
come back come back come back to me like
you could you could if you just said you are sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie you would be here by now
if you are out there if you are somewhere if you are moving on
i have been waiting for you ever since you have been gone
i just want it back the way it was before
and i just want to see you back at my front door
and i say come back come back come back to me like
you would before you said it is not that easy
before the fight before i locked you out
but i take it all back now
come back come back come back to me like
you would you would if this was a movie
stand in the rain outside till i came out
come back come back come back to me like
you could you could if you just said you are sorry
i know that we could work it out somehow
but if this was a movie you would be here by now
you would be here by now
it is not the kind of ending you want to see now
baby what about the ending
oh i thought you would be here by now
thought you would be here by now
tall dark and superman
he puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
to save the world or go to work
it is the same thing to me
he is got his mother's eyes his father's ambition
i wonder if he knows how much that i miss him
i hang on every word you say yay
and you smile and say how are you
i say just fine
i always forget to tell you i love you i love you forever
i watch superman fly away
you have got a busy day today
go save the world i will be around
i watch superman fly away
come back i will be with you someday
i will be right here on the ground
when you come back down
tall dark and beautiful
he is complicated he is irrational
but i hope someday you will take me away and save the day yeah
something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
he is not all bad like his reputation
and i cannot hear one single word they say
and you will leave got places to be and i will be ok
i always forget to tell you i love you i loved you from the very first day
i watch superman fly away
you have got a busy day today
go save the world i will be around
i watch superman fly away
come back i will be with you someday
i will be right here on the ground
when you come back down
and i watch you fly around the world
and i hope you do not save some other girl
do not forget do not forget about me
i am far away but i never let you go
i am lovestruck and looking out the window
do not forget do not forget where i will be
right here wishing the flowers were from you
wishing the card was from you
wishing the call was from you
because i loved you from the very first day
i watch superman fly away
you have got a busy day today
go save the world i will be around
forever and ever here
i watch superman fly away
i swear i will be with you someday
i will be right here on the ground
when you come back down
la la la la la la
la la la la la la
when you come back down
i am walking fast through the traffic lights
busy streets and busy lives
and all we know is touch and go
we are alone with our changing minds
we fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time
and i never saw you coming
and i will never be the same
you come around and the armor falls
pierce the room like a cannon ball
now all we know is do not let go
we are alone just you and me
up in your room and our slates are clean
just twin fire signs four blue eyes
so you were never a saint
and i have loved in shades of wrong
we learn to live with the pain
mosaic broken hearts
but this love is brave and wild
and i never saw you coming
and i will never be the same
this is a state of grace
this is the worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right
these are the hands of fate
you are my achilles heel
this is the golden age of something good
and right and real
and i never saw you coming
and i will never be the same
and i never saw you coming
and i will never be the same
this is a state of grace
this is a worthwhile fight
love is a ruthless game
unless you play it good and right
loving him is like driving a new maserati
down a deadend street
faster than the wind passionate as sin
ending so suddenly
loving him is like trying to change your mind
once you are already flying through the free fall
like the colors in autumn so bright
just before they lose it all
losing him was blue like i would never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red
touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
was right there in front of you
memorizing him was as easy as knowing
all the words to your old favorite song
fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
and realizing there is no right answer
regretting him was like wishing you never found out
that love could be that strong
losing him was blue like i would never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red
remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
tell myself it is time now gotta let go
but moving on from him is impossible
when i still see it all in my head
in burning red
loving him was red
losing him was blue like i would never known
missing him was dark grey all alone
forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
but loving him was red
and that is why he is spinning 'round in my head
comes back to me burning red
yeah yeah
his love was like driving a new maserati down a deadend street
put your lips close to mine
as long as they do not touch
out of focus eye to eye
till the gravity's too much
and i will do anything you say
if you say it with your hands
and i would be smart to walk away
but you are quick sand
this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
and i i i like it
i cannot decide if it is a choice
getting swept away
i hear the sound of my own voice
asking you to stay
and all we are is skin and bone trained to get along
forever going with the flow but you are friction
this slope is treacherous
this path is reckless
this slope is treacherous
and i i i like it
two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive
and i will follow you follow you home follow you follow you home
this hope is treacherous
this daydream is dangerous
this slope is treacherous
and iii iii iii
two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive
and i will follow you follow you home follow you follow you home
this hope is treacherous
this daydream is dangerous
this hope is treacherous
iii iii iii 
two headlights shine through the sleepless night
and i will get you get you alone
your name has echoed through my mind
and i just think you should think you should know
that nothing safe is worth the drive
and i will follow you follow you home follow you follow you home
i will follow you follow you home follow you follow you home
this slope is treacherous
and iii like it
once upon a time a few mistakes ago
i was in your sights you got me alone
you found me you found me you found me
i guess you did not care and i guess i liked that
and when i fell hard you took a step back
without me without me without me
and he is long gone when he is next to me
and i realize the blame is on me
because i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i would never been
till you put me down oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i would never been
now i am lying on the cold hard ground
oh oh
trouble trouble trouble
oh oh
trouble trouble trouble
no apologies he will never see you cry
pretends he does not know that he is the reason why
you are drowning you are drowning
you are drowning
and i heard you moved on from whispers on the street
a new notch in your belt is all i will ever be
and now i see now i see
now i see
he was long gone when he met me
and i realize the joke is on me hey
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i would never been
till you put me down oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i would never been
now i am lying on the cold hard ground
oh oh
trouble trouble trouble
oh oh
trouble trouble trouble
and the saddest fear comes creeping in
that you never loved me
or her or anyone or anything yeah
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i would never been
till you put me down oh
i knew you were trouble when you walked in
so shame on me now
flew me to places i would never been
now i am lying on the cold hard ground
oh oh
trouble trouble trouble
oh oh
trouble trouble trouble
i walked through the door with you the air was cold
but something 'bout it felt like home somehow and i
left my scarf there at your sister's house
and you have still got it in your drawer even now
oh your sweet disposition
and my wideeyed gaze
we are singing in a car getting lost upstate
the autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
and i can picture it after all these days
and i know it is long gone and that magic's not here no more
and i might be okay but i am not fine at all
because there we are again on that little town street
you almost ran the red because you were looking over at me
wind in my hair i was there i remember it all too well
photo album on the counter
your cheeks were turning red
you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed
and your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
you taught me about your past thinking your future was me
and i know it is long gone and there was nothing else i could do
and i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed to
because there we are again in the middle of the night
we are dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
down the stairs i was there i remember it all too well yeah
and maybe we got lost in translation
maybe i asked for too much
but maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'till you tore it all up
running scared i was there i remember it all too well
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
i am a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
because i remember it all all all too well
time will not fly it is like i am paralyzed by it
i would like to be my old self again
but i am still trying to find it
after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
now you mail back my things and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
because it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you cannot get rid of it because you remember it all too well yeah
because there we are again when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you have ever known
it was rare i was there i remember it all too well
wind in my hair you were there you remember it all
down the stairs you were there you remember it all
it was rare i was there i remember it all too well
it feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
and make fun of our exes uh uh uh uh
it feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
to fall in love with strangers uh uh uh uh
yeah
we are happy free confused and lonely at the same time
it is miserable and magical oh yeah
tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
it is time uh uh
i do not know about you but i am feeling 22
everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
you do not know about me but i bet you wanted to

it seems like one of those nights
this place is too crowded too many cool kids uh uh uh uh

instead of sleeping

it is miserable and magical oh yeah
tonight's the night when we forget about
the heartbreaks it is time

i was reminiscing just the other day
while having coffee all alone and lord it took me away
back to a firstglance feeling on new york time
back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
took off faster than a green light go
hey you skip the conversation when you already know
i left a note on the door with a joke we would made
and that was the first day
and darling it was good never looking down
and right there where we stood was holy ground
spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
we had this big wide city all to ourselves
we blocked the noise with the sound of 'i need you'
and for the first time i had something to lose
and i guess we fell apart in the usual way
and the story's got dust on every page
but sometimes i wonder how you think about it now
and i see your face in every crowd
because darling it was good never looking down
and right there where we stood was holy ground
tonight i am gonna dance for all that we have been through
but i do not wanna dance if i am not dancing with you
tonight i am gonna dance like you were in this room
but i do not wanna dance if i am not dancing with you
it was good never looking down
and right there where we stood was holy ground
tonight i am gonna dance for all that we have been through
but i do not wanna dance if i am not dancing with you
tonight i am gonna dance like you were in this room
but i do not wanna dance if i am not dancing with you
long handwritten note deep in your pocket
words how little they mean when you are a little too late
i stood right by the tracks your face in a locket
good girls hopeful they will be and long they will wait
we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
in dreams i meet you in warm conversation
we both wake in lonely beds different cities
and time is taking its sweet time erasing you
and you have got your demons and darling they all look like me
we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
distance timing breakdown fighting
silence the train runs off its tracks
kiss me try to fix it could you just try to listen
hang up give up and for the life of us we cannot get back
we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
we had a beautiful magic love there
what a sad beautiful tragic love affair
new to town with a made up name
in the angel city chasing fortune and fame
and the camera flashes make it look like a dream
you had it figured out since you were in school
everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool
so overnight you look like a sixties' queen
another name goes up in lights like diamonds in the sky
and they will tell you now you are the lucky one
yeah they will tell you now you are the lucky one
but can you tell me now you are the lucky one oh oh oh
now it is big black cars and riviera views
and your lover in the foyer does not even know you
and your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
and they tell you that you are lucky
but you are so confused
cause you do not feel pretty you just feel used
and all the young things line up to take your place
another name goes up in lights
you wonder if you will make it out alive
and they will tell you now you are the lucky one
yeah they will tell you now you are the lucky one
but can you tell me now you are the lucky one oh oh oh
it was a few years later i showed up here
and they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
how you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
they say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
chose a rose garden over madison square
and it took some time but i understand it now
cause now my name is up in lights but i think you got it right
let me tell you now you are the lucky one
let me tell you now you are the lucky one
let me tell you now you are the lucky one oh oh oh
and they will tell you now you are the lucky one
yeah they will tell you now you are the lucky one
and they will tell you now you are the lucky one oh oh oh
oh whoa oh oh
all i knew this morning when i woke
is i know something now know something now i did not before
and all i have seen since 18 hours ago is green eyes and freckles and your smile
in the back of my mind making me feel like
i just want to know you better

i just want to know you better
know you better know you better now
i just want to know you better

taylor swift
and all my walls stood tall painted blue
and i will take them down

taking flight making me feel like

so dust off your highest hopes

and everything has changed

all my days i will know your face
all i know since yesterday is everything has changed
i said oh my what a marvelous tune
it was the best night never would forget how we moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing dancing
like we are made of starlight
like we are made of starlight
i met bobby on the boardwalk summer of '45
picked me up late one night at the window
we were 17 and crazy running wild wild
cannot remember what song it was playing when we walked in
the night we snuck into a yacht club party
pretending to be a duchess and a prince
and i said oh my what a marvelous tune
it was the best night never would forget how we moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing dancing
like we are made of starlight starlight
like we are made of starlight starlight
he said look at you worrying too much about things you cannot change
you will spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way
he was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
do not you see the starlight starlight
do not you dream impossible things
like oh my what a marvelous tune
it was the best night never would forget how we moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing dancing
like we are made of starlight starlight
like we are made of starlight starlight
ooh ooh he is talking crazy
ooh ooh dancing with me
ooh ooh we could get married
have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream
oh my what a marvelous tune
it was the best night never would forget how we moved
the whole place was dressed to the nines
and we were dancing dancing
like we are made of starlight starlight
like we are made of starlight starlight
like we are made of starlight starlight
like we dream impossible dreams
like starlight starlight
like we dream impossible dreams
do not you see the starlight starlight
do not you dream impossible things
took a deep breath in the mirror
he did not like it when i wore high heels
but i do
turn the lock and put my headphones on
he always said he did not get this song but i do i do
walked in expecting you would be late
but you got here early and you stand and wave
i walk to you
you pull my chair out and help me in
and you do not know how nice that is but i do
and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it is strange that you think i am funny because he never did
i have been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
you said you never met one girl who
had as many james taylor records as you
but i do
we tell stories and you do not know why i am coming off a little shy
but i do
and you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it is strange that you think i am funny because he never did
i have been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
and we walked down the block to my car
and i almost brought him up
but you start to talk about the movies
that your family watches every single christmas
and i want to talk about that
and for the first time what is past is past
because you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
i think it is strange that you think i am funny because he never did
i have been spending the last eight months
thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
but on a wednesday in a cafe i watched it begin again
you should have been there
should have burst through the door
with that 'baby i am right here' smile
and it would have felt like
a million little shining stars had just aligned
and i would have been so happy
christmas lights glisten
i have got my eye on the door
just waiting for you to walk in
but the time is ticking
people ask me how i have been
as i comb back through my memory
how you said you would be here
you said you would be here
and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and they are all laughing
as i am looking around the room
but there was one thing missing
and that was the moment i knew
and the hours pass by
now i just wanna be alone
but your close friends always seem to know
when there is something really wrong
so they follow me down the hall
and there in the bathroom
i try not to fall apart
and the sinking feeling starts
as i say hopelessly
he said he would be here
and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and they are all laughing
and asking me about you
but there was one thing missing
and that was the moment i knew
what do you say
when tears are streaming down your face
in front of everyone you know
and what do you do when the one
who means the most to you
is the one who did not show
you should have been here
and i would have been so happy
and it was like slow motion
standing there in my party dress
in red lipstick
with no one to impress
and they are all standing around me singing
happy birthday to you
but there was one thing missing
and that was the moment i knew
ohohohohohohohohohohohoh
i knew
ohohohohohohohohohohohoh
you call me later
and said i am sorry i did not make it
and i said i am sorry too
and that was the moment i knew
you said it in a simple way
4 am the second day
how strange that i do not know you at all
stumbled through the long goodbye
one last kiss then catch your flight
right when i was just about to fall
i told myself do not get attached
but in my mind i play it back
spinning faster than the plane that took you
and this is when the feeling sinks in
i do not wanna miss you like this
come back be here come back be here
i guess you are in new york today
i do not wanna need you this way
come back be here come back be here
the delicate beginning rush
the feeling you can know so much
without knowing anything at all
and now that i can put this down
if i had known what i would known now
i never would have played so nonchalant
taxi cabs and busy streets
that never bring you back to me
i cannot help but wish you took me with you
and this is when the feeling sinks in
i do not wanna miss you like this
come back be here come back be here
i guess you are in london today
i do not wanna need you this way
come back be here come back be here
this is falling in love in the cruelest way
this is falling for you and you are worlds away
new york be here
but you are in london and i break down
cause it is not fair that you are not around
i do not wanna miss you like this
come back be here
come back be here
do not look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
do not look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
i do not even know her
but i feel a responsibility to do what is upstanding and right
it is kinda like a code yeah
and you have been getting closer and closer
and crossing so many lines
and it would be a fine proposition
if i was a stupid girl
but honey i am no one's exception
this i have previously learned
so do not look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
do not look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
i see you turn off your phone
now you have got me alone and i say
do not look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
i just want to make sure
you understand perfectly you are the kind of man who makes me sad
while she waits up you chase down the newest thing
and take for granted what you have
and it would be a fine proposition
if i was a stupid girl
and yeah i might go with it
if i had not once been just like her
so do not look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
do not look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
i see you turn off your phone
now you have got me alone and i say
do not look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
call a cab lose my number
you are about to lose your girl
call a cab lose my number
let us consider this lesson learned
want to see you pick up your phone
and tell her you are coming home
do not look at me you got a girl at home
and everybody knows that everybody knows that
it would be a fine proposition
if i had not once been just like her
walking through a crowd the village is aglow
kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
everybody here wanted something more
searching for a sound we had not heard before
and it said
welcome to new york

your necklace hanging from my neck
the night we could not quite forget
when we decided we decided
to move the furniture so we could dance

two paper airplanes flying flying flying
and i remember thinking

twenty stitches in a hospital room
when you started crying baby i did too

but the monsters turned out to be just trees

clear blue water high tides came and brought you in
and i could go on and on on and on
and i will
skies grew darker currents swept you out again
and you are just gone and gone gone and gone
in silent screams and wildest dreams
i never dreamed of this
this love is good this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
tossing turning struggle through the night with someone new
and i could go on and on on and on
lantern burning flickered in my mind for only you
but you were still gone gone gone
been losing grip sinking ships
you showed up just in time
this love is good this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
this love left a permanent mark
this love is glowing in the dark
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
your kiss my cheek i watched you leave
your smile my ghost i fell to my knees
when you are young you just run
but you come back to what you need
this love is good this love is bad
this love is alive back from the dead
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
this love left a permanent mark
this love is glowing in the dark
these hands had to let it go free
and this love came back to me
you stand with your hand on my waistline
it is a scene and we are out here in plain sight
i can hear them whisper as we pass by
it is a bad sign bad sign
something happens when everybody finds out
see the vultures circling dark clouds
love's a fragile little flame
it could burn out it could burn out
because they got the cages they got the boxes
and guns
they are the hunters we are the foxes
and we run
baby i know places we will not be found
and they will be chasing their tails trying to track us down
because i i know places we can hide
i know places i know places
lights flash and we will run for the fences
let them say what they want we will not hear it
loose lips sink ships all the damn time
not this time
just grab my hand and do not ever drop it
my love
they are the hunters we are the foxes
and we run
baby i know places we will not be found
and they will be chasing their tails trying to track us down
because i i know places we can hide
i know places i know places
they are the hunters we are the foxes
and we run
just grab my hand and do not ever drop it
my love
baby i know places we will not be found
and they will be chasing their tails trying to track us down
because i i know places we can hide
i know places i know places
they take their shots we are bulletproof
i know places
and you know for me it is always you
i know places
in the dead of night your eyes so green
i know places
and i know for you it is always me
i know places
the drought was the very worst
when the flowers that we would grown together died of thirst
it was months and months of backandforth
you are still all over me like a winestained dress i cannot wear anymore
hung my head as i lost the war
and the sky turned black like a perfect storm
rain came pouring down
when i was drowning that is when i could finally breathe
and by morning gone was any trace of you
i think i am finally clean
there was nothing left to do
when the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
so i punched a hole in the roof
let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
the water filled my lungs i screamed so loud
but no one heard a thing
rain came pouring down
when i was drowning that is when i could finally breathe
and by morning gone was any trace of you
i think i am finally clean
i think i am finally clean
ten months sober i must admit
just because you are clean do not mean you do not miss it
ten months older i will not give in
now that i am clean i am never gonna risk it
the drought was the very worst
when the flowers that we would grown together died of thirst
rain came pouring down
when i was drowning that is when i could finally breathe
and by morning gone was any trace of you
i think i am finally clean
rain came pouring down
when i was drowning that is when i could finally breathe
and by morning gone was any trace of you
and i think i am finally clean
flashing lights and we
took a wrong turn and we
fell down a rabbit hole
you held on tight to me
cause nothing's as it seems and spinning out of control
did not they tell us do not rush into things
did not you flash your green eyes at me
have not you heard what becomes of curious minds
did not it all seem new and exciting
i felt your arms twistin' round me
i should have slept with one eye open at night
we found wonderland you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever ey ey
we found wonderland you and i got lost in it
and life was never worse but never better ey ey
ey ey ey ey ey
in wonderland
ey ey ey ey ey
in wonderland
ey ey ey ey ey
in wonderland

so we went on our way too in love to think straight
all alone or so it seemed
but there was strangers watching
and whispers turned to talking
and talking turned to screams oh
did not they tell us do not rush into things
did not you flash your green eyes at me
did not you calm my fears with a cheshire cat smile
did not it all feel new and exciting
i felt your arms twisting round me
its all fun and games till somebody loses their mind
but darlin'
we found wonderland you and i got lost in it
and we pretended it could last forever ey ey
we found wonderland you and i got lost in it
and life was never worse but never better ey ey
ey ey ey ey ey
in wonderland

i reached for you but you were gone
i knew i had to go back home
you searched the world for something else
to make you feel like what we had
and in the end in wonderland
we both went mad
oh
we found wonderland you and i got lost in it
we pretended it could last forever last forever ey ey
we found wonderland you and i got lost in it got lost in it
and life was never worse but never better never better ey ey

one look dark room meant just for you
time moved too fast you play it back
buttons on a coat lighthearted joke
no proof not much but you saw enough
small talk he drives coffee at midnight
the light reflects the chain on your neck
he says look up and your shoulders brush
no proof one touch you felt enough
you can hear it in the silence silence you
you can feel it on the way home way home you
you can see it with the lights out lights out
you are in love true love
you are in love
morning his place burnt toast sunday
you keep his shirt he keeps his word
and for once you let go of your fears and your ghosts
one step not much but it said enough
you kiss on side walks you fight and you talk
one night he wakes strange look on his face
pauses then says you are my best friend
and you knew what it was he is in love
you can hear it in the silence silence you
you can feel it on the way home way home you
you can see it with the lights out lights out
you are in love true love
and so it goes
you two are dancing in the snowglobe round and round
and he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
and you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
and why i spent my whole life trying to put it into words
because you can hear it in the silence
you can feel it on the way home
you can see it with the lights out
you are in love true love
you are in love
you can hear it in the silence silence you
you can feel it on the way home way home you
you can see it with the lights out lights out
you are in love true love
you are in love
you can hear it in the silence silence you
you can feel it on the way home way home you
you can see it with the lights out lights out
you are in love true love

we are all bored we are all so tired of everything
we wait for trains that just are not coming
we show off our different scarlet letters
trust me mine is better
we are so young but we are on the road to ruin
we play dumb but we know exactly what we are doing
we cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
honey life is just a classroom
because baby i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream
baby we are the new romantics
come on come along with me
heartbreak is the national anthem
we sing it proudly
we are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
baby we are the new romantics
the best people in life are free
we are all here the lights and noise are blinding
we hang back it is all in the timing
it is poker you cannot see it in my face
but i am about to play my ace
we need love but all we want is danger
we team up then switch sides like a record changer
the rumors are terrible and cruel
but honey most of them are true
because baby i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream
baby we are the new romantics
come on come along with me
heartbreak is the national anthem
we sing it proudly
we are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
baby we are the new romantics
the best people in life are free
please take my hand and
please take me dancing and
please leave me stranded
it is so romantic it is so romantic
because baby i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream
because baby i could build a castle
out of all the bricks they threw at me
and every day is like a battle
but every night with us is like a dream
baby we are the new romantics
come on come along with me
heartbreak is the national anthem
we sing it proudly
we are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet
baby we are the new romantics
the best people in life are free

and you should think about the consequence
of you touching my hand in a darkened room

our secret moments in a crowded room
they got no idea about me and you
there is an indentation in the shape of you
made your mark on me a golden tattoo
all of this silence and patience pining and anticipation
my hands are shaking from holding back from you
ha ah ah
all of this silence and patience pining and desperately waiting
my hands are shaking from all this
ah ha ha haah
say my name and everything just stops
i do not want you like a best friend

because i do not want you like a best friend
only bought this dress so you could take it off
take it oh ha ha haah
inescapable i am not even gonna try
and if i get burned at least we were electrified
i am spilling wine in the bathtub
you kiss my face and we are both drunk
everyone thinks that they know us
but they know nothing about
all of this silence and patience pining and anticipation
my hands are shaking from holding back from you
ha ah ah
all of this silence and patience pining and desperately waiting
my hands are shaking from all this
ah ha ha haah

flashback when you met me
your buzzcut and my hair bleached
even in my worst times you could see the best of me
flashback to my mistakes
my rebounds my earthquakes
even in my worst lies you saw the truth in me
and i woke up just in time
now i wake up by your side
my one and only my lifeline
i woke up just in time
now i wake up by your side
my hands shake i cannot explain this

it was so nice throwing big parties
jump into the pool from the balcony
everyone swimming in a champagne sea
and there are no rules when you show up here
bass beat rattling the chandelier
feeling so gatsby for that whole year
so why'd you have to rain on my parade
i am shaking my head and locking the gates
this is why we cannot have nice things darling
because you break them
i had to take them away
this is why we cannot have nice things honey
did you think i would not hear all the things you said about me
this is why we cannot have nice things
it was so nice being friends again
there i was giving you a second chance
but then you stabbed in the back while shaking my hand
and therein lies the issue
friends do not try to trick you
get you on the phone and mindtwist you
and so i took an axe to a mended fence
but i am not the only friend you have lost lately
if only you were not so shady
this is why we cannot have nice things darling
because you break them
i had to take them away
this is why we cannot have nice things honey
did you think i would not hear all the things you said about me
this is why we cannot have
here is a toast to my real friends
they do not care about the hesaidshesaid
and here is to my baby
he is not reading what they call me lately
and here is to my momma
had to listen to all this drama
and here is to you
because forgiveness is a nice thing to do
haha i cannot even say it with a straight face
this is why we cannot have nice things darling darling
because you break them
i had to take them away
this is why we cannot have nice things honey
did you think i would not hear all the things you said about me
this is why we cannot have nice things darling
and here is to my real friends
because you break them
i had to take them away
and here is to my baby
this is why we cannot have nice things darling
he did not care about that hesaidshesaid
did you think i would not hear all the things you said about me
this is why we cannot have nice things
my castle crumbled overnight
i brought a knife to a gunfight
they took the crown but it is alright
all the liars are calling me one
nobody's heard from me for months
i am doin' better than i ever was
because
my baby's fit like a daydream
walking with his head down
i am the one he is walking to

my baby's fly like a jet stream
high above the whole scene
loves me like i am brand new
so call it what you want yeah
call it what you want to
all my flowers grew back as thorns
windows boarded up after the storm
he built a fire just to keep me warm
all the drama queens taking swings
all the jokers dressing up as kings
they fade to nothing when i look at him
and i know i make the same mistakes every time
bridges burn i never learn
at least i did one thing right
i did one thing right
i am laughing with my lover makin' forts under covers
trust him like a brother
yeah you know i did one thing right
starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night
my baby's fit like a daydream
walking with his head down

chain round my neck
not because he owns me
but because he really knows me
