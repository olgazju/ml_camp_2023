    "## Objectives:\n",
    "- **Model Selection**: Trying out different models to see which one performs the best.\n",
    "- **Model Tuning**: Optimizing the performance of the selected model.\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.\n",

    "## Dataset:\n",
    "In this notebook, we will be working with the cleaned dataset located at `./data/features/movies_dataset.parquet`, which is the result of feature engineering process in the preceding EDA Notebook.\n"
